// In order to indicate that sortAlgorithm is a dependency of ComplexBusinessService,
// you use the @Autowired annotation, Spring manages the instances of every class
// with the @Component annotation, with @Autowired -> Spring will look for the
// dependency among the components it manages to find a match

// Spring will create an instance of BubbleSortAlgorithm and it will pass it
// to the constructor of ComplexBusinessService when creating an instance

	@Component

// Terminology

	//Beans:

		//With the @Component annotation we are telling Spring to manage 
		//instances of ComplexBusinessService and BubbleSortAlgorithm,
		//these instances are called Beans

		//Beans are the different objects managed by the Spring framework

	//Autowiring:

		//The process where Spring identifies the dependencies, identifies
		//the matches for the dependencies and populates them 

	//Dependency injection:

		//Injecting the instance required into the Bean that requires it

	//Inversion Of Control:

		//The instance of the dependency is no longer created by the class
		//that needs it itself, the control is given to the framework
		//instead

	//IOC Container:

		//A generic term that represents anything implementing Inversion Of 
		//Control. In the Spring framework the typical IOC Container is '
		//the Application Context

	//Application Context:

		//Is where all the beans are created and managed, where all the 
		//core logic of the Spring framework happens
